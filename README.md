# Trail of Light

## Overview

**Trail of Light** is a 2D side-scrolling web game in which you guide *Minka*, a stray cat with bioluminescent eyes, through a world plunged into endless night.  
A monstrous creature named *Umbra* has stolen the final starry glow, and Minka’s friend *Lux* — the last spark of hope — has been captured.

Your goal is to collect light fragments scattered throughout the darkness while avoiding Umbra’s monstrous minions.  
If you manage to gather **10 light fragments**, you restore hope — at least for a little while.
